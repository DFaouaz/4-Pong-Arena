# Game Concept
**4-Pong Arena** is a local multiplayer arcade game for up to 4 players in the same vein as classics such as Pong, but with twice the pads, multiple times the balls in play and a hundred times the fun. Users can play against other players, and computer-controlled pads with AI behaviour, in frantic Pong matches with random ball spawns, electric scenarios and fist-pumping music to acompany it all.

But that's not all. Every map can be adjusted with different obstacles such as bouncers in the middle of the map, and a force field of different sizes that powers-up any ball that goes inside with more speed, to make it harder for whomever is on the other side of the field.

# About the game

# Lore

The entire kingdom gathers to watch the Ghost Games!

Years ago, a curse was casted upon the kingdom and condemned the dead to return as ghosts. The King ordered to lock all those affected in the castle dungeons and gradually the curse dissapeared from the kingdom.

Despite knowing the cure, the King has taken the opportunity to create a show that attracts tourists from other kingdoms.

The king created a tournament where soldiers who were affected by the curse, and have not been treated, face each other in a battle to the death. The victor gains his freedom and the cure to the curse.

You are one of those soldiers and you must show your skill and cunning in combat against the rest.
