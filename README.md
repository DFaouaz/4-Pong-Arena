# Game Concept
**4-Pong Arena** is a local multiplayer arcade game for up to 4 players in the same vein **as classics such as Pong**, but with twice the pads, multiple times the balls in play and a hundred times the fun. Users can play against other players, and **computer-controlled pads** with AI behaviour, in frantic Pong matches with **random ball spawns**, electric scenarios and fist-pumping music to acompany it all.

But that's not all. Every map can be adjusted with **different obstacles** such as bouncers in the middle of the map, and a **force field** of varying sizes that powers-up any ball that goes inside with more speed, to make it harder for whomever is on the other side of the field.

# About the game
